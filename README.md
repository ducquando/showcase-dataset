Raw dataset for the Showcase app's database

This dataset was created with enormous supports from sites that generate customizable randomized string. Specifically:
- Titles are generated by TweakYourBiz's [Title Generator](https://tweakyourbiz.com/title-generator)
- Contents are generated by TextTool's [Article Generator](https://textool.io/unique-silly-article-generator)
- Author's names are generated by [Name Generator](https://www.name-generator.org.uk/quick/)
- Picture are generated and fetched from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos)
- Initial user's article and field points are generated using [RANDOM.ORG](https://www.random.org)

Once set up all the data, we will run [Database Generator.py](/generator/Database%20Generator.py) to create a new database file from the inputed .csv files. All the files are located in the [generator](/generator) folder.
